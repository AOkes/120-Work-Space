For this sketch, I decided to stick with the snow theme.  I had a few difficulties with this sketch, particularly with the snow sticking together a lot.  After awhile I managed to minimize this as best as I could, however I was unable to have as much snow as I would have liked. I did find that reducing the size allowed me to place more snow so that not as many would clip into each other as often.
