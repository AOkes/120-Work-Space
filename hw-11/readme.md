During the creation of this sketch, I had the inspiration to make it look like snow fall that you can make, due to the snowy weather that I have recently gotten in town.  While making this sketch, the only issue I ran into was the placement of the Snow class, as when I placed it lower, it would not work.  When looking this up I found that it was because it could not be used when declared after being used, so I had to place the class higher in the coding.  Thankfully this was the only issue I ran across and it did not require me to ask my classmates for assistance.
