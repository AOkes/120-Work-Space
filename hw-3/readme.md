For this week, I was actually very familiar with the way the coding worked in Atom, as I have had experience writing code before over a program called Code Montana.  After refreshing my memory by reading through the modules, I was able to create my files with relative ease and understanding. Throughout the assignment I fortunately did not run into any issues regarding the files or repository uploading.  I did learn more about index.html and how that is important in websites, and found it interesting to look into.
