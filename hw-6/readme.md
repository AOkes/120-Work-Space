This week for the algorithmic sketch, I wanted to keep the type of sketch simple, yet mesmerizing at the same time, so I could more easily handle figuring out the coding, without overwhelming myself.  Following through the module and playing with the code, I managed to come up with a result I was quite pleased with. Over this assignment I did not find myself needing to ask my classmates for assistance on the github website.
