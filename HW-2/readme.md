## Answers

 1. The work I did for this homework cycle was utilizing GitHub's repo feature to display my work on Atom after answering these questions for this week's homework cycle.
 2. The steps I took to complete this assignment were to start by reading through the instructions on the course website, and then follow them step by step, and if I were to get confused, look on GitHub to see if there were any answers to my questions before posting the question myself.
 3. The main problems I had were understanding, which I had solved through reading through the material again on the course website, and I did not need to look for help from my classmates.
 For example, by reading back through I learned how to properly use backticks:
 ```
 For displaying code like this.
 Or even this.
 ```
 4. There was nothing that I found in particular that I wanted to discuss further, as I felt it was all very thoroughly explained.
 5. I found no issues that I was able to assist my fellow classmates with this homework cycle as any whose were posted were already answered when I found them.
