# Final Proposal

For my final project, I felt that I wanted to create a Pac-Man style game, however instead of surviving 4 ghosts and collecting points, it would have constantly spawning enemies that the player would have to avoid or fend off for as long as they can to earn points.  Of course this is inspired by Pac-Man as well as games that continue without end in efforts to get the highest score you can, examples being Temple Run, Flappy Bird, and Call of Duty Zombies.  Some problems I will likely have to solve will probably include how to deal with the enemies, making sure the enemies and player cannot go through walls of the level, and methods of keeping track of the player's score.  My internal deadlines will likely be daily at night, and broken into sections, such as; Day 1: Walls, Day 2: Fully Functioning Controllable Player Character, and so on. Some work I have completed this week is an outline of what my player character shall look like, the walls, and my enemies.  I have also begun to work on the code for the player character.
