# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--
--This is a Comment Block--

In this sketch, the code works the way it does because of the if statements in place.  With these if statements, at any point if the ball meets the edge of the screen, the program will notice it, and change the ball's direction.  To create the line drawing effect of the ball, the program tracks where the ball is and draws an ellipse in its place every time it moves.

## How did you alter the sketch?

<!--
While messing around with the sketch, I stumbled across a neat looking effect using the mouse press feature, to where whenever the mouse is pressed, the background color changes and the ball no longer has strokes, giving a sort of neonish look to me, which I found fun.
