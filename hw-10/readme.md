For this assignment, when I saw the smiley example, I immediately thought of doing a similar setup with instead rainbow slinkies or DNA strands.  Unfortunately I was not able to work out making it look like DNA, so I stuck with slinkies, and I was happy with the end result. Since I was familiar with arrays and functions from previous programming languages, I was able to easily adapt to using it with p5.
